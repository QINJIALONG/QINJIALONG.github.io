# ACADEMIC WORKS

## Independent Research: Enhancing Sequential Recommendation Systems utilizing LLMs and Knowledge Graphs  
- First paper that utilizes self-supervised methods to predict latent item relationships in dynamic knowledge graphs based on LLM for relation-aware sequential recommender systems.  
- Harnesses the language knowledge to discover latent relations and flexible to work with existing relation-aware sequential recommenders through joint learning.  
- Significantly improves the performance of existing relation-aware sequential recommendation models and achieve state of the art performance on real world public recommendation data set.

## Co-First Author: A Dynamic Analysis Approach in Racket Sports. SPCS. [EI conference]  
- Employed ARIMA, TOPSIS method and Lasso regression to quantify and predict momentum disparities among players.  
- Analyzed the momentum fluctuation of players focusing on the 2023 Wimbledon Men's Singles and other events.

# ACADEMIC PROJECTS

## WWW2025 Multi-modal Dialogue System Intent Recognition Challenge  
**Beijing, China**  
- Fine-tuned VLM Qwen2-vl-7B using 4*A800(80G) GPUs and achieved an 8% improvement above baselines successfully.  
- Data Augmentation: Infuse prior knowledge into the dataset to enhance performance in data-sparse scenarios.  
- Self-Consistency: Employ multiple reasoning paths to ensure the correctness of the answers.  
- Pretraining: Utilize pseudo-labeling to introduces a wealth of domain knowledge while applying gradient clipping to mitigate the adverse effects of noisy labels on the training process.  
- Intent Summarization: Summarize user-specific intents and filter out noise to refine the input.
